              <h2>Uncanny Valley and the new-age Tech Worker Experience</h2>
              <p>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir is a memoir written about the Silicon Valley startup industry. Although published in 2020, the events of the memoir conclude around 2018. It explores Anna Wiener's personal experience with startups, as she worked for a few. Some of the notable ones include Mixpanel and GitHub, although she never explicitly names them in the memoir. In the account, she explains some of the hardships she experienced as a female tech worker. While there are many accounts of what it is like to work in Silicon Valley, Wiener's is unique.</p>

              <h2>Who is Anna Wiener? Why is she relevant?</h2>
              <p>Anna Wiener grew up outside of the tech industry, initially working in publishing. Describing this career as "old" and "slow", she ventured into the tech industry after her first job at an e-book startup. Wiener is important to this conversation because she is a good example of the inequalities that are not unique to, but exacerbated in the tech industry. Wiener faced a lot of hardship related to her gender, which is all too common in the tech industry.</p>

              <h2>Different Tech Workers Face Different Problems</h2>
              <p>Wiener's problems, while they are a good example of the tech industry's failings, are not the only ones. Tech is a unique field for labor rights and inclusion of differing identities. The term "Glass Escalator" has been used to describe the tendency for men to be promoted into higher-ranking positions above women. However, studies have shown that it is even more complicated than that within tech. Assuming a ladder-like structure of management, with the engineer on the bottom, middle management in the center, and administration at the top, women (particularly white women) are likely to be promoted into the middle section, but never progress. This prevents the engineering teams- a historically male-dominated field, from having to truly integrate women, by moving them up one level. However, there is still a cap for these women's progress, as they are seldom moved above these "middle" levels.</p>

              <h2>"Move Fast and Break Things"</h2>
              <p>The quote "Move Fast and Break Things" is a common mindset that is associated with Silicon Valley tech work. Unfortunately, the break-age does not simply apply to the barriers of technology, they often apply to the labor rights and HR systems of more traditional companies. Due to startups' small size, they tend to lack a traditional HR system which lets abuses get swept under the rug. The avoidance of labor laws and systems that are in place for a reason is typically paid in blood- that of the startup employees.</p>

              <h2>Gambling your Salary</h2>
              <p>Startups have a unique way of providing payment for their workers. While they do use traditional salaries, they are often less than what can be earned at a larger company, due to their minimal capital. However, they tend to offer "stock options" to make up for these gaps in salary. A stock option has little to no worth upon joining the company, but the idea is that if the company grows, your stock will be worth millions. There is, however, no guarantee of this.</p>

              <h2>Stay For The Stock</h2>
              <p>Another issue with this stock-style payment is that it encourages employees to stay in poor working conditions. Stock options are often tightly regulated by the company, with strict rules about when an employee is allowed to receive or purchase stock. Generally, these rules are designed to convince employees to stay for longer periods of time. It is not irregular to see stock vesting options that would require to take up to four years to complete. This means that if an employee were to quit or resign at any time before their vesting was complete, they could receive a fraction or even none of the stock options they were promised when joining the company.</p>
