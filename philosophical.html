                    <p>In The Future of Work and Death, authors explore how work has shaped human civilization, not only as a means of survival but as a source of identity, community, and personal fulfillment. Historically, one's profession often defined their role in society — farmers, artisans, orators, and later, industrial workers all found purpose within their labor.</p>

                    <p>Harari's concept of the “Useless Class” in Homo Deus warns of a potential future where millions could be rendered economically obsolete due to automation and AI. Unlike past revolutions that created new forms of employment, the rise of AI challenges the very necessity of human labor in many sectors. This raises questions about societal responsibility towards those displaced by technology.</p>

                    <p>Classic workers' rights have centered on fair pay, satisfactory working conditions, and employment protection. But when most economic production is performed by machinery, perhaps workers' rights need to have a different set of priorities.
