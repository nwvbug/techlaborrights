                  <h2>Constantly Undermined</h2>
                  <p>Bethanye Blount, a software engineer, came into work to interview a job applicant. She held a senior position at the company, dressed professionally, and had extensive technical experience. As such, it was shocking when the job applicant repeatedly blew her off with disrespectful comments. However, the moment that a male interviewer was sent in, he became respectful and attentive. It is unfortunately common for women in tech to have their experience or credibility undermined, including by people who don't even work at the company in question. Oftentimes, the most prevalent roadblocks in terms of career progression for minorities, and especially women, are not overt sexist statements, but a more subtle disrespect and dismissal. This can prove much more difficult to prove, and therefore solve.</p>

                  <h2>Why is Tech different?</h2>
                  <p>Tech work does not have a long history- meaning it doesn't have a history of exclusion. Older fields have had to grapple with the introduction of new demographics, whereas the field of tech largely came about after these demographics were in the workforce. It is argued by Liza Mundy, the author of "Why is Silicon Valley so awful to women?" that Silicon Valley's tendency to attribute success to inherent "brilliance" or "genius" is unique, and also the root cause of some of Silicon Valley's issues. A 2015 study that Mundy cites shows that the more a field values "giftedness", the fewer female PhD recipients there are. (This statistic also holds true for African Americans.)</p>

                  <h2>Meritocracy- or so it seems</h2>
                  <p>Tech is consistently described as a ‘meritocracy’, or an industry in which anyone can succeed, provided they are skilled enough. However, in reality, it is not always this pure. Max Papadantonakis, in his short essay “Silicon Valley’s Occupational Caste System” explains how Silicon Valley can instead be understood as an “occupational caste system” (Papadantonakis 2). In short, this means that while some of your success in Silicon Valley is dictated by your skill, many people remain stuck within the ‘caste’ they began in. This is used to explain the barriers to employment that highly educated Black, Latinx, and other underrepresented groups of workers face.</p>
