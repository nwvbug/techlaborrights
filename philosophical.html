                    <p>In The Future of Work and Death, authors explore how work has shaped human civilization, not only as a means of survival but as a source of identity, community, and personal fulfillment. Historically, one's profession often defined their role in society — farmers, artisans, orators, and later, industrial workers all found purpose within their labor.</p>

                    <h2>The Impact of Automation</h2>
                    <p>Harari's concept of the “Useless Class” in Homo Deus warns of a potential future where millions could be rendered economically obsolete due to automation and AI. Unlike past revolutions that created new forms of employment, the rise of AI challenges the very necessity of human labor in many sectors. This raises questions about societal responsibility towards those displaced by technology.</p>

                    <h2>Expanding the Definition of Labor Rights</h2>
                    <p>Classic workers' rights have centered on fair pay, satisfactory working conditions, and employment protection. But when most economic production is performed by machinery, perhaps workers' rights need to have a different set of priorities. The debate will likely shift around how to assure human dignity, self-expression, and opportunity to make a significant contribution, separate from economic necessity.</p>

But this vision must be accomplished through careful societal reorganization to avoid worsening inequality.</li></p>
