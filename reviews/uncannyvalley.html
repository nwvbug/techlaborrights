                In a world that comes closer to revolving around tech every passing day, Anna Wiener's memoir *Uncanny Valley* provides a fresh perspective on the startup industry. While there are numerous accounts of Silicon Valley's most all-consuming industry, Wiener's unique background allows her to stand out in a saturated market. This fresh perspective is in large part what allows this to happen. She was not raised in the Bay Area; she began her career on the East Coast working for self-described “old” and “slow” publishing houses and did not even know how to code. Despite this, she managed to make a life for herself after moving out West due to disappointment in the lack of career advancement in the publishing industry.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Wiener, with a sense of dry humor, dances around explicitly naming any of the companies she worked for. However, is it easy enough to piece together what she is referring to- between a certain “analytics startup”, “open source startup”, or “the social media everyone hated” (although she did not work for that one). Wiener's book is full of relatable experiences, described masterfully with a hint of humor, which hints towards what the target audience of this memoir was; those looking for a balanced account of the Silicon Valley experience, particularly recent graduates interested in the startup lifestyle.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The memoir begins by recounting Wiener's experiences as an assistant at a publishing house in New York. She has been surrounded by people in this industry for her entire adult life, but she grows antsy with the lack of career advancement. Her parents ask why, at twenty-five, she is still working as an assistant. Her friends, doing the same thing she is, say that she simply has to wait. However, this does not suit Wiener.   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	As such, when a distinctly un-traditional company, focused on providing e-books for a monthly subscription appears in New York, close to where Wiener already works, she decides to take this opportunity. It's not a decision she took lightly- many of the people in her life don't think this is a good idea. Wiener and her friends were self-described as “analog”. Prior to her journey into Silicon Valley, she did not even own a digital camera. These descriptions of herself exemplify part of the reason this book is so unique. Wiener staunchly does not fit the stereotype of the tech worker.   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This job was not just about money- it made her feel valuable. As such, when it was later learned that Wiener was not as valued as she believed she was, the decision for her to move on was made for her. The founders of the startup informed her that this was not the place she was supposed to be, but as a parting gesture, they gave her the information of a contact out West. This contact supposedly was riding a “rocket ship”, or maybe a “unicorn”- their startup was destined for success.   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Wiener makes it out west and she arrives at the startup, revealed to be a lucrative big-data analytics startup, as a contract worker. The startup was a stark contrast from her publishing job, and even to the e-book one she was at prior. The interview was quirky, nobody wore traditional office attire, and they skateboarded around the office. While it made Wiener uncomfortable at first, she brushed it off. Some may call this an ability to “go with the flow”, but Wiener describes this as a “people-pleasing” tendency, and it is one that comes up later in the book, to her disadvantage.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Wiener spent a few years at the analytics startup, and that time had many highs and lows. She made friends with her coworkers, but she also felt ostracized by the company's culture. The company had issues with severe misogyny and discrimination, and only 6 of the 50 employees were women. No HR department existed to help resolve conflicts, and as such, sexual assault reports were typically dismissed.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In addition to these issues, Wiener became less fond of the company as it grew. It began to lose its "startup" culture, hiring generalistic employees. More importantly to Wiener, the company's mission seemed to shift. Around this time, she had an awakening about the company's true nature. The company had begun to sell its analytics data to non-tech (advertising) companies as well as the US government. The discrimination and moral issues were becoming too much for her, and she began to look outward.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A friend told Wiener about a company that she believed would fit Wiener well, an open-source code hosting platform. She received an offer to work there, and accepted. Saying goodbye to her old company was difficult, despite the hardships that occurred there. She still had people whom she was fond of at the analytics startup, and she had overall liked the company. Regardless, she knew that the new open-source startup was where she wanted to be.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Although the open-source startup had issues previously, Wiener spoke about it favorably. Her team had nearly 50% women, which was a breath of fresh air after her previous position. Wiener goes on to detail how she and the team dealt with misuse of the platform, including to stalk and target other women. Despite these challenging issues, Wiener felt relatively at home at this company. She came into the office, despite not having to, and used the company amenities. Wiener here sets up a future discussion about how salaries and tech workers intersect.   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Explaining a conversation she had with the CEO of a different startup, Wiener explains her gripes with Silicon Valley; its reckless speed, “move fast break things”, and exclusionary attitude. This disagreement with the core tenets of the startup industry is what makes Wiener a perfect author for this memoir: she highlights things that insiders would simply gloss over. She has accomplished something akin to a double-agent: she went very deep into Silicon Valley, yet did not (in the long run) conform to it.   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Wiener transitions into discussion more about the entrepreneurial class and the impact of startups on particularly San Francisco, but at large, the world. She explains how startup founders' focus on efficiency and lack of care for the humanistic side of things leads to the failure of larger-scale projects. An example is given for a “city run like a startup”, where the leaders disregarded nearly everything related to the community in the city.	  
At this point, Wiener's memoir begins to wind down. She is feeling like she is stuck in the past. At 29, she is still participating, like all startup employees, in the parties and drinking. She commiserates with a 40 year old coworker, who remarks, “Wasn't I supposed to have children?”   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Wiener's own wants lead her to eventually exit from the open-source startup. She is able to take advantage of the stock options that were given to her, taking out her entire savings to do so. Upon the eventual acquisition by Microsoft, this stock would give her hundreds of thousands of dollars. Wiener, by that point, had exited tech completely and returned to her passion: writing.   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In the words of another reviewer, “Uncanny Valley is a different sort of Silicon Valley narrative” (Muhammad). Given that she is not an engineer, nor an entrepreneur, she was able to shed some light on what it is like working at a startup company as a non-entrepreneurial type. Wiener's tale is cautionary at times, praising at others, and simply humorous on various occasions. The book flows quite well and it did not require much motivation to keep reading. Given that it is a chronological story, Wiener did a good job organizing the book, although the middle part, relating to the analytics startup, can drag on at times. She provides commentary on nearly all aspects of the experience- being a woman in tech, being a liberal arts major in tech, being a New Yorker in San Francisco, and being a non-Silicon-Valley-ist in Silicon Valley.   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Another important facet of Wiener's account of Silicon Valley is how willing she is to explore her own complicitness in it. Many writers will record their accounts in a way that highlights the good and bad of Silicon Valley, but leave themselves out of it. However, Wiener explores how Silicon Valley changed her, and not just for the better. There is an underlying theme of shame that is seen within the book, and as another reviewer says, “without the frisson of shame, Uncanny Valley would be a completely different book, and not nearly as good” (Harris).   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This book succeeds in being a balanced representation of Silicon Valley- the highs and the lows. A common critique of it is that it overblows the negatives whilst ignoring the positives. However, this critique disregards that Wiener herself is, for the majority of the book, overwhelmingly in favor of what Silicon Valley has to offer. This book is neither a scathing critique of startup culture, nor is it a glowing endorsement. It is, however, an extremely unique, balanced, and enjoyable to read representation of what the young tech workers deal with when working in Silicon Valley.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
